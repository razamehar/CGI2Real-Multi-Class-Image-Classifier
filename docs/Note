Entire Mode: entire_model.h5 (Multiple chunks in compressed format)
Model Weights: model_weights.h5 (Multiple chunks in compressed format)
Training Datasets:
  - Human: train-person.rar ((Multiple chunks in compressed format)
  - Horse: train-horse.zip
  - Both: train-both.zip
Validation Datasets:
  - Human: val-person.zip
  - Horse: val-horse.zip
  - Both: val-both.zip
Test Dataset: test.zip

Important: Since GitHub restricts file uploads to 25 MB, I've split the "entire_model.h5" file into 17 smaller chunks, "model_weight.h5" filme into 7 chunks, and 
the "train-person" dataset into 13 chunks. To combine them, you'll need compression and archiving software like WinRAR. Once merged, you can extract the model and 
images.
